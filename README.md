# Honeywell Pressure Sensors
This is a light weight Arduino library for interacting with pressure sensors from Honeywell's TruStability Board Mount collection.

Datasheets:

- [SPI Technical Notes] (http://sensing.honeywell.com/spi-comms-digital-ouptu-pressure-sensors-tn-008202-3-en-final-30may12.pdf)
- [I2C Technical Notes] (http://sensing.honeywell.com/i2c-comms-digital-output-pressure-sensors-tn-008201-3-en-final-30may12.pdf)
 
__Currently, this library only supports SPI, but I2C and Analog functionality are forthcoming!__

## Functions
Here is a complete list of the functions. 
```cpp
readPressure();
readTemp();
getStatus();
```

## Examples
The following example programs demonstrate how to use the library.  

```cpp
/*
This program gets pressure readings from Honeywell's 
TruStability SPI pressure sensor. Was tested with SSCMLNN030PASA3 and  HSCDRRN015PDSA5
*/

#include <Honeywell_pressure_sensors.h>
#include <SPI.h>

//for sensor: SSCMLNN030PASA3
HPS hps(1, 16384.0, 0.0, 30.0, 0.0); // cs is pin 1, outputMax=16384, outputMin=0, pressureMax=30, pressureMin=0

//for sensor HSCDRRN015PDSA5
//HPS hps(1, 14746.0, 1638.0, 15.0, -15.0); // cs is pin 1, outputMax=14746, outputMin=1638, pressureMax=15, pressureMin=-15

void setup(){
    Serial.begin(9600);
    SPI.begin();
    SPI.beginTransaction(SPISettings(800000, MSBFIRST, SPI_MODE0));
}

void loop(){
    Serial.println(hps.readPressure());
    delay(500);
}
```
